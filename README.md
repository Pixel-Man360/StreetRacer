# Street Racer

Street Racer is an Open-world racing game prototype inspired by Need For Speed Heat and Forza Horizon 5. This game features a mid-scale map with three different areas: City, Desert, and Forest.  
It has two different race modes: Time-attack and Sprint.  
As this project is just a prototype, the race logic and AI logic are very simple due for now.  
All the project codes are inside the Scripts folder. The scenes folder contains all the scenes.

## Important: Required Asset Packs

This project uses several third-party asset packs that **are not included** in this repository due to licensing restrictions. You will need to **purchase or download these packs separately** from the Unity Asset Store or the original creators to use the project properly.

The following asset packs are required for the project to function as intended:

- Cartoon Low Poly City  
- DOTween (free tweening library)  
- Epic Toon FX  
- Fantasy Skybox Free  
- Flipbook VFX  
- Particle VFX Pack  
- Polygon Particle FX Pack  
- Polygon City Pack  
- Polygon Nature Biomes Pack  
- Polygon Street Racer Pack  
- Polygon Western Frontier Pack  
- Racing Game Garage  

### How to Get and Import the Packs

1. **Purchase or download each asset pack** from the Unity Asset Store or their official sources. Here are some helpful links:  
   - [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/)  
   - Search for each pack by name to find the official page.

2. **Import the packs into your Unity project**:  
   - Open your project in Unity.  
   - Go to **Assets > Import Package > Custom Package...** (if you downloaded `.unitypackage` files) or use the **Package Manager** to import purchased assets directly.  
   - Import all assets and dependencies included in each pack.

3. **Ensure the Packs folder is located in the root of the project** with the correct folder structure to avoid broken references.

4. **Open the project only after importing all required packs** to prevent missing assets or errors.

If you encounter any missing references or errors related to assets, please verify that all packs are imported correctly.
