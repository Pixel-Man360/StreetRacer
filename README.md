Street Racer

Note: I do not own the assets. Those were made and all rights reserved by Synty.

Street Racer is an Open-world racing game prototype inspired from Need For Speed Heat and Forza Horizon 5. This game features a mid-scale map with three different areas: City, Desert and Forest.
It has Two different race modes: Time-attack and Sprint. 
As this project is a prototype and a submission to a university lab, the race logic and AI logic are very simple due to the time constraint. 

Systems Implemented:
1) Physics based driving system
2) AI
3) Level Generator Tool (Used to all 6 races)
4) Save/Load system
5) Economy
6) Rewards System

Future Work (If I get the time to work on it again):
1) Minimap
2) Race Position Show
3) Better AI
4) Crowd-Simulation
5) World events
6) Map events
7) Shop
8) Car Modification
